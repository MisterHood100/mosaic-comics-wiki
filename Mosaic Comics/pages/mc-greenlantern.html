          <h2>GREEN LANTERN</h2>
          <p>Before he was Green Lantern, John Stewart was an architect from Detroit, Michigan. After the man who was to take up the mantel next, Guy Gardner, was seriously injured in a disater, the The Guardians of the Universe were tasked to find another replacement. They would end up selecting John Stewart. The OG Green Lantern, Hal Jordan, would object to this decision after seeing that Stewart had a belligerent attitude to authority figures. However, the Guardians would stand by their selection. In the end, Jordan would comply and hand Stewart his uniform and power ring. Jordan's skepticism of Stewart would remain strong and be ever further cemented during their mission of protecting a racist politician. Jordan believed that Stewart would allow hatred to cloud his judgement and keep him from making the right decision even if it meant saving a less than honorable man. This would initialy seem to be the case when Stewart would refuse to act when an apparent African American assassin would shoot at the politician and Jordan would have to move on the situation instead. However, Stewart had good reasons for this apparent dereliction of duty when he would stop a gunman from killing a police officer in the outside parking lot at the event while Jordan was pursuing a decoy. When Jordan would confront Stewart for his actions, Stewart would effectively explained the situation of the ruse and the fact the politician staged it for political advantage. Jordan would realize that Stewart was even a step ahead of himself and that maybe it was his own predilections that clouded his own judgement about Stewart. After this event Jordan would conclude that Stewart was an excellent recruit after all.</p>
          <p>There are many reasons why John Stewart as Green Lantern is my absolute favorite superhero, but his origin story is probably the best example of why. Writing for Black superheroes was something that I always found troublesome for the comic book world but John's origin story was definitely one of the ones that was done right. I felt that it perfectly addressed two issues. The problem of concieved notions due to surface level judgements and how these notions can easily be upset when one is able to look beyond the surface and actually see what's going on. Beyond his origin, John's use of the power ring has always intrigued me as a Green Lantern fan. Because he is an architect, he has been shown to use his ring in more inventive and creative ways that show just how strong the power of a Green Lantern can be if they think outside of the box.</p>
