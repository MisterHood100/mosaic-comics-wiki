          <h2>GOTENKS</h2>
          <p>Gotenks, previously known as Trunkten, is the immensely powerful fusion of Goten and Trunks successfully using the Fusion Dance. This is the first successful fusion dance character to be seen in the Dragon Ball series. He likes to call himself, "The Hero of Justice" or "Grim Reaper of Justice". Gotenks is a fusion taught to Goten and Trunks by Goku, and is later trained by Piccolo. He is one of the fusions performed through the use of the Fusion Dance technique. The dance is a special type of fusion ability, a connection through the fusees' fingers. The fusees need to perform a special type of pose, then connect their index fingers evenly to produce a perfect fusion. He, like Gogeta, is summoned out of desperation to defeat powerful enemies. In Gotenks' case, this enemy is Majin Buu. Gotenks is very young, but powerful, and is very playful and an extreme procrastinator. He has a quite cocky and rebellious personality. He likes to do things his own way and has been told more than once that he acts more like Vegeta than anyone else. Gotenks thinks he is in total control, and has everything in his hands. He is able to perform a few transformations, increasing his power and making him more confident and deadly in battle. He is quite creative and original, and creates a broad, yet ridiculous array of his own attacks. However, some of his creative techniques do inflict potent damage, such as his Super Ghost Kamikaze Attack, or his Galactic Donut.</p>
          <p>Gotenks is a special case for this list. While nowhere near the most important or prominant character in the Dragon Ball series, he, to me, is without a doubt the most rediculous. In my eyes, Gotenks is the ultimate archetype of having all the talent in the world meaning nothing if you lack discipline and don't train hard. But it is this reason why he is one of my favorites. Crazy, right? He seemingly serves the purpose of showing why Goku and the other Z Fighters train so hard. Another reason why Gotenks is one of my favorites is his fighting style. All flash, no substance. He has some of the most rediculous super moves you will ever see in any anime. And that's saying a whole lot. He spits out mini-ghost versions of himself and sends them charging at his foe kamikaze style. But the ghosts are just as rediculous as he is himself. Which brings up another reason why he is one of my favorites. His outlandish, supremely arrogant personality. He can't beat anybody in the world and doesn't have to train a day to do it. At least this is what he believes all the way up until he's facing his own imminent defeat at the and throwing a tantrum like the bratty pre-teen that he is.</p>
          <p>This was a small rundown of just exactly who the Gotenks is and why he's one of my favorite superheroes. Are you a fan of Gotenks? If so, how about you click the <b>BUTTON</b> below and take the <b>MY HERO QUIZ</b> to see just how much of a fan you truly are.</p>
