          <h2>GOKU</h2>
          <p>Born on the dying Planet Vegeta, baby Kakarot was sent off-world in a spaceship in a last ditch effort to save the dying Saiyan race. He would crash land on earth and be adopted by a farmer named Gradpa Gohan who would name him Goku. Sounds familiar, right? Don't worry, this gets way crazier than Superman. Early on, Goku's alien ways would be truly realized when he would turn into a Gorilla Kaiju under the moonlight and, tragically, kill his Grandpa. This would leave Goku an orphan and he would embark on incredible journies to the west. These journies would lead him around the world where he would be trained by the best martial arts masters, battle powerful foes, in wich many, would later become friends. He would go on to get married, have children, even granchildren, die, come back to life, transform, fuse and save the world over and over again. Told you it gets crazier than Superman. But still not quite as rediculous as Batman.</p>
          <p>Goku is one of my favorite superheroes because he is the personification of training paying off. If there is one thing that is true about Goku, its that absolutely no one outworks him. If he's not eating, he's training. He trains so much that he's missed important battles because he was so busy training that he forgot that he forgot there was a fight. However, when he does show up to fight, he's got some new trick up his sleeve that makes him nearly impossible to defeat. I know that it's always be a point of ire for DBZ fans that no matter how impossible the task, Goku always finds a way to save the day.  But, I personally have never had a problem with it. The idea of a person's power being limitless as long as you continue to train hard is something that is often rare for superheroes, unless their Batman, and a unique power for a superhero to have.</p>
          <p>This was a small rundown of just exactly who the Goku is and why he's one of my favorite superheroes. Are you a fan of the Goku? If so, how about you click the <b>BUTTON</b> below and take the <b>MY HERO QUIZ</b> to see just how much of a fan you truly are.</p>
