          <h2>STORM</h2>
          <p>Ororo Munroe is the descendant of an ancient line of African priestesses, all of whom have white hair, blue eyes, and the potential to wield magic. Ororo herself would inherit the ability to wield such magic. Her mother, N'Daré, was the princess of a tribe in Kenya, who married the American photojournalist, David Munroe, and moved with him to Manhattan, where Ororo was born. As the daughter of a Kenyan tribal princess and of an American photojournalist who lived in Cairo, Egypt, she became an orphan after a plane crashed on and destroyed her home. The young Ororo became a sneak-thief on the streets of Cairo under the tutelage of Achmed El Gibár, who provided her a home. As a teenager, she felt an urge to travel to the south, arriving to the Serengeti plains. Venerated by the locals as a goddess, Ororo used her abilities to ease the droughts in the arid desert. She was eventually approached by Professor Xavier to join his X-Men, a mutant group aimed at implementing peace between humans and mutants. Adopting the name Storm, Ororo accepted the offer, intending to comprehend the origin and the potential of her powers.</p>
          <p>While a lot of the X-Men are great in their own rite, Storm always stood out to me. When it comes to origins, I've always been a sucker for inherited power through family lineage. While this is the case for mostly all of the X-Men, for Storm it seems to be... for lack of a better word, bigger. It almost seems godly, like being a demi-god to and an olympian of greek mythology. The power to control the weather and bring thunder and lightning, literally striking down your foe is truly powerful. I've always been a fan of how Storm was represented. Whenever she goes into battle she announces her presence and lets you know exactly what kind of fury that she's bringing with her. Although it came across as overdone at times in the animated series, I always felt that it gave her massive presence and let you know that she was one of the strongest heroes there and definitely an Omega-Level mutant.</p>
          <p>This was a small rundown of just exactly who Storm is and why he's one of my favorite superheroes. Are you a fan of Storm? If so, how about you click the <b>BUTTON</b> below and take the <b>MY HERO QUIZ</b> to see just how much of a fan you truly are.</p>
