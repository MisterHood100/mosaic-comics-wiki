          <h2>SHAZAM</h2>
          <p>Billy Batson became an orphan at a young age after his parents, C.C. and Marilyn Batson, died. He went from foster home to foster home until he landed in an orphanage in Philadelphia. At the age of fifteen Billy was placed in the care of Victor and Rosa Vasquez, both former foster children themselves, who had already adopted a number of children.  Billy moved in to the Vazquezes' home where he met his new foster-siblings Mary, Freddy, Eugene, Pedro, and Darla. Billy refused to connect to the other children and rejected their attempts to get close to him. However, overtime, he would grow closer with his siblings and even step in to defend his them from bullies who were picking on them at school. One night Billy would sneak out of the house and hijack one of the bullies' father's car. Billy would be caught but escape on an underground train at the metro station. The train would transform into a gateway to the Rock of Eternity, where Billy would meet the Wizard. The Wizard would search deep into Billy's soul and see all the good Billy had done in his life. The Wizard would bestow his power upon him. With a word, Billy would transform into the champion, Shazam, and wield the Living Lightning. After granting Billy all of his power, the Wizard died. As Shazam, he would go on to battle against dangerous foes alongside the great heroes in the DC Universe, including his brothers and sisters.</p>
          <p>What always made Shazam so cool to me was that his alter ego was his alter ego, Billy Batson, and how he got his powers. He just happened to be in the right place at the right time and he was rearded for being, although troubled, a good kid who was pure of heart. Talk about the ultimate reward for being good. Takes notes, Santa. Shazam also has some of absolute best wish fulfillment appeal in all of comics because it’s two fantasies in one. With one magic word, "SHAZAM!", Billy Batson goes from being a kid to an adult (what kid didn’t fantasize about that?). And second, the magic word that transforms him into an adult also transforms him into a marvelous superhero with the powers of gods, putting him on (though arguably above) Superman’s level.</p>
