          <h2>SAITAMA</h2>
          <p>Saitama is a bald-headed 25-year-old man who is bored of fighting because he is effortlessly able to defeat enemies with a single punch. Three years prior to this, when he still had hair, Saitama was job hunting when he defeated the powerful supervillain Crablante that attempted to kill a child with his buttocks on his chin. Saitama would then initiall become a hero "for the fun of it" but quickly develop supernatural physical abilities magnified to an immeasurable degree. He attribute this to an intense but simple daily training regimen consisting of 100 push-ups, 100 sit-ups, 100 squats, a 10 km run, eating healthy food, not using the air conditioner or heater to reinforce his mental fortitude, and training even when his body was wounded and made strange cracking sounds. This routine would seem to have pushed his powers beyond limits of anyting imagineable to a mere mortal man, allowing him to destroy an enemy with a single punch. Thus, One-Punch Man. He would soon join the hero association. Though he would break all the physical records in the Hero entrance exam by huge margins, Saitama would enter the Hero Association with a score of 71, giving him one of the lowest ranks in the Hero Association. This was due to his miserable performance on the mental exam. Many of his heroic efforts are often not recognized because of collateral damage or his tendency to not mind letting others have the recognition due to his indifferent personality.</p>
          <p>I could go on this long winded tirade about why Saitama is one of my favorite superheroes but it really is as simple as he can defeat any and everything with a single punch... Nuff said. Also, he got his powers by just doing some basic exercises that anybody can do. The only downfall is that he lost all his hair. But for most guys, that's gonna happen at some point anyway.</p>
          <p>This was a small rundown of just exactly who the Saitama is and why he's one of my favorite superheroes. Are you a fan of Saitama? If so, how about you click the <b>BUTTON</b> below and take the <b>MY HERO QUIZ</b> to see just how much of a fan you truly are.</p>
