          <h2>BLACK PANTHER</h2>
          <p>T'Challa was a born prince. Son of queen N'Yami and King T'Chaka, the then ruler and protector of Wakanda as Black Panther. At the young age of five, he witnessed the villanous Ulysses Klaw murder his father. Even at that young age, T'Challa would show his bravery by maiming Klaw with his own weapon and forcing him to retreat. After T'Chaka's death, T'Challa's uncle would assume the role of Black Panther. T'Challa would travel abroad to further his education. Years later, T'Challa would return to Wakanda and, under an alias, challenge and defeat his uncle for the right to be Black Panther. He would then undergo the ritual of ingesting the Heart-Shaped Herb and making himself one with the Bast, the Panther God. Bast would gift T'Challa with great powers, making him nearly superhuman. With his enhanced abilities, genius level intellect, suit made of vibranium, military and endless resources as new king of Wakanda, T'Challa would would stand strong with his nation behind him as the new Black Panther.</p>
          <p>Although I have said many times before that John Stewart as Green Lantern is my favorite superhero... it depends on the day. Because on given day my favorite superhero could just as well be the Black Panther. In my eyes he is definitely the best and easily the coolest superhero ever created. Not only is he an ultra-powerful superhero, but he is also a king to the most powerful and advanced nation in the entire world, Wakanda. His name is cool, his powers are cool, his suit is cool, his country is cool, everything about Black Panther is that he is cool. I mean, at one point his wife and queen is none other than the X-Men's own, Storm. Talk about a SUPER POWER COUPLE. I like a lof of other superheroes but Black Panther tops them all.</p>
